            Hi! My name is Sophia D’Agostino and I am a sophomore Television, Radio, Film major and Marketing minor at Syracuse University. I am interested in film and television marketing and both streaming and theatrical distribution. Here at school, I am very involved in campus activities that allow me to strengthen my skills regarding my major. I am a Content Creator for our campus news station’s late night television show ‘Cuse Tonight, where I am responsible for creating bi-weekly comedy videos for our broadcast. I am also the Intra-Organizational liaison for the Marketing board of University Union, which is Syracuse’s student entertainment board. Throughout my time as a part of this organization I have helped put together several campus events spanning from movie nights on the quad to concerts with artists including Role Model, Latto, Ashe, and many more.  

This semester, I am gaining real- world experience as a Creative Intern with American High, where I assist with marketing campaigns, script coverages, and more.  

Outside of work and school, I love spending time with my family and friends, exploring new coffee shops, traveling, and watching as many movies and tv shows as I can!
